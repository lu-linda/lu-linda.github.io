I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at Cornell University. I am advised by [Karthik Sridharan](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sridharan/). My research interests are in theoretical machine learning, particularly in the design of trustworthy learning algorithms that meet theoretical guarantees of privacy, fairness, and robustness. My work is supported by a 2024-2025 [Bowers-CIS Linkedin Fellowship](https://cis.cornell.edu/eight-scholars-awarded-cornell-bowers-cis-linkedin-grants).

Before joining Cornell, I received a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania. I was a member of the Jerome Fisher Management and Technology program,
