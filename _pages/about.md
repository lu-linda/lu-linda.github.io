This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

About Me
======
I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at Cornell University. I am advised by [Karthik Sridharan](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~sridharan/). My research interests are in theoretical machine learning, particularly in the design of trustworthy learning algorithms that meet theoretical guarantees of privacy, fairness, and robustness. My work is supported by a 2024-2025 [Bowers-CIS Linkedin Fellowship](https://cis.cornell.edu/eight-scholars-awarded-cornell-bowers-cis-linkedin-grants).

Before joining Cornell, I received a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania. I was a member of the Jerome Fisher Management and Technology program,
